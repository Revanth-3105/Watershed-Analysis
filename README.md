Watershed Analysis of the Indus River Basin in Ladakh Region Using QGIS
Project Overview
This lab project, conducted in the RS and GIS Lab under the guidance of Dr. Satish Regonda, focuses on the watershed analysis of the Indus River Basin in the Ladakh region using QGIS. The project involves processing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files, addressing sink issues, and deriving watershed boundaries. Additionally, the project includes analyzing catchment metrics and generating channel networks, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the hydrological characteristics of the region.

Objectives
DEM Processing: Process DEM files to prepare them for hydrological analysis, including resolving sink issues.
Watershed Delineation: Derive accurate watershed boundaries for the Indus River Basin using QGIS tools.
Catchment Analysis: Analyze key catchment metrics such as area, slope, and flow accumulation.
Channel Network Generation: Generate and visualize channel networks based on the processed DEM data.
Key Features
Sink Issue Resolution: Applied hydrological corrections to DEM data, ensuring accurate representation of the terrain.
Watershed Boundary Derivation: Utilized QGIS for precise watershed boundary delineation, crucial for effective water resource management.
Catchment Metrics: Comprehensive analysis of catchment characteristics, providing insights into the hydrological behavior of the basin.
Channel Network Visualization: Generated detailed channel networks, aiding in the understanding of water flow patterns within the watershed.
